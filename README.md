**Sqlitch** is a Python port of the popular [Sqitch] database change management application. It provides the same powerful, framework-agnostic approach to database schema management with the convenience and ecosystem of Python.

## What is Sqlitch?

Sqlitch is a database change management system that helps you manage database schema changes in a sane, reliable way. It's a Python implementation of the proven Sqitch methodology.

### Key Features

* **No opinions** - Not tied to any framework, ORM, or platform. Works with any Python application or standalone.

* **Native scripting** - Changes are implemented as scripts native to your database engine. Writing a PostgreSQL application? Write SQL scripts for `psql`.

* **Dependency resolution** - Database changes can declare dependencies on other changes, ensuring proper execution order even when changes are committed out-of-order.

* **Deployment integrity** - Manages changes via a plan file using a Merkle tree pattern similar to Git, ensuring deployment integrity without requiring numbered migrations.

* **Iterative development** - Modify your change scripts as often as you like until you tag and release. Perfect for test-driven database development.

## Supported Databases

Sqlitch currently supports:

* **PostgreSQL** 8.4+ (including YugabyteDB and CockroachDB)
* **SQLite** 3.8.6+
* Additional database engines coming soon

## Installation

### From PyPI (when available)

```bash
pip install sqlitch
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ovid/sqlitch.git
cd sqlitch
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize a new project:**
   ```bash
   sqlitch init myproject --engine pg
   ```

2. **Add your first change:**
   ```bash
   sqlitch add users --note "Add users table"
   ```

3. **Deploy to your database:**
   ```bash
   sqlitch deploy
   ```

4. **Verify your deployment:**
   ```bash
   sqlitch verify
   ```

5. **Check deployment status:**
   ```bash
   sqlitch status
   ```

## Documentation

* [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) - Your first steps with Sqlitch
* [Command Reference](docs/commands.md) - Complete command documentation
* [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) - How to configure Sqlitch
* [PostgreSQL Tutorial](docs/tutorial-postgresql.md) - Detailed PostgreSQL walkthrough

## Relationship to Original Sqitch

Sqlitch is a faithful Python port of the original [Sqitch] Perl application created by David E. Wheeler. It aims to provide 100% compatibility with Sqitch's:

* Plan file format
* Configuration system  
* Command-line interface
* Database registry schema
* Change deployment logic

This means you can use Sqlitch as a drop-in replacement for Sqitch in Python environments, or even migrate existing Sqitch projects to use Sqlitch.
